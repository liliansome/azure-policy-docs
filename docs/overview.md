# Azure Policy Overview

## What is Azure Policy?
Azure Policy is a service in Azure that allows you to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies enforce different rules and effects over your resources, so those resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service level agreements.

## Key Concepts

### Policy Definition
A policy definition expresses what to evaluate and what action to take. Each definition has conditions under which it's enforced.

### Policy Assignment
A policy assignment is a policy definition that has been assigned to take place within a specific scope.

### Scope
Scopes are resource groups, subscriptions, or management groups that the policy applies to.
